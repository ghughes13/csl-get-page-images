  <h3 align="center">Get Page Images</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A user friendly way for people to get any image they want from a website.
  </p>
</div>

## Roadmap

- [x] Get Alt Tag For Images (If available)
- [x] Get images used in the css background property
- [x] Figure out way to detect if image should be displayed on dark background for accessibility. (This doesn't seem possible due to cross origin restrictions. Just added dark mode instead)
- [x] Improve UI
